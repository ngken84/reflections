Question 1

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local

-When you use multiple computers
-When you want to back up your work
-When you want to share your work
_When you want to collaborate with other users. 

Question 2
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Because you may make changes locally that may get overwritten by online changes.
