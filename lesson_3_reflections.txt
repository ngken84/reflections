Question 1

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local

-When you use multiple computers
-When you want to back up your work
-When you want to share your work
_When you want to collaborate with other users. 

Question 2
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Because you may make changes locally that may get overwritten by online changes. 

Question 3
Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of the other

Fork - a github copy of another user's github repository. Used when you want to make your own 
changes to another user's repository.

Clone - a local copy of another user's github repository. Used when you want to make your own 
changes of another user's repository on your local machine

Branch - a set of changes made to a repository that exists separately from the master branch of your own
repository. Used when you want to make changes to a repository that do not affect the master branch but 
later can be merged with other branches.

Question 4
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Allows for resolution of merging conflicts between the local and remote versions of the repository

Question 5
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

On the local master, create a new branch, make changes, push them to git hub and make a pull request. 
Allow collaborators to comment on changes and perform the pull request if it is acceptable. 

Question 6
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When you are collaborating on a project and do not want to touch the master until it is approved or commented on.
